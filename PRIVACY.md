# Atheneum Privacy Policy

Atheneum requires a number of permissions to function properly. The most important is the CAMERA permission which is needed to scan the bar codes behind most modern books. That eases the process of getting your books into your library quickly. The ISBN read from the bar codes are used to pull information about the book like the authors and publisher. That data is gotten from Google books and the data is is persisted on your atheneum account and not shared with any other third party.
